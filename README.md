# YumYumBook

**Project Purpose:**

The purpose of YumYumBook is to transform cooking habits by making detailed recipes available to the user and promoting sustainability in the digital age. It can contain more recipes than in a physical cookbook which saves space in the kitchen. Unlike cooking blogs where you need to scroll through various ads and authorâ€™s backstories, our product makes finding the measurements and steps easier by only providing the user with crucial information. It also allows users to save their favorite recipes in a digital folder, create their own recipes, make an ingredient list to make grocery shopping easier, and enhance community by commenting on recipes.
